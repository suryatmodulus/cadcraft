<p align="center">
  <b>Computer-aided design and drafting; an open-source, clean-room reimplementation of Autodesk AutoCAD, rebuilt in pure Rust.</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  A fast, open-source take on the AutoCAD workflow: the command line, object snaps, layers,
  dimensions, hatches, blocks and DXF drawings you already know. It runs natively on macOS,

## Why CADCraft

- **The workflow you know.** Type `L`, click two points, type `@5<45`, press Enter. The command
  line, prompts with clickable `[Keywords]`, AutoComplete, object snaps, polar tracking, ortho,
  direct distance entry, window and crossing selection, grips, and right-click-to-repeat behave
  the way decades of drafting habit expect.
- **Open files.** DXF is read and written natively (ASCII and binary, R12 through 2018), and DWG
  files (R13 through 2018) open and save through the open-source acadrust library. Export to SVG
  and PNG today.
- **Fast and native.** Pure Rust and egui, no Electron, no web view. One binary on macOS
  (universal), Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, plus a WebAssembly build for the browser.
- **Built for agents.** Every menu item, tool and prompt is a command. Agents can type at the
  command line exactly like a person, call any command with JSON, inspect the drawing to verify
  their work, and render it — over MCP, a JSON control channel, or the CLI.
- **Free.** MIT OR Apache-2.0, with no account and no subscription.

## What works today

CADCraft is in early, fast development. Honest status (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for parity
numbers):

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Drawing area | Model space with adaptive grid, axes, pan/zoom (wheel, middle-drag, pinch), crosshair cursor with pickbox, UCS icon, ViewCube, viewport label |
| Command line | Prompts with keywords, history, AutoComplete, aliases, `@dx,dy`, `@d<a`, `#x,y`, direct distance entry, Enter/space/right-click to repeat, transparent commands, `.scr`-style scripts |
| Draw | LINE, PLINE (arcs, widths), CIRCLE (center/radius/diameter, 2P, 3P), ARC, RECTANG (fillet/chamfer), POLYGON, ELLIPSE (+arcs), SPLINE, POINT, XLINE, RAY, DONUT, TEXT, MTEXT |
| Modify | ERASE, MOVE, COPY, ROTATE, SCALE, MIRROR, STRETCH, OFFSET, TRIM, EXTEND, FILLET, CHAMFER, BREAK, JOIN, EXPLODE, rectangular/polar ARRAY, draw order, OVERKILL |
| Precision | Object snaps (endpoint, midpoint, center, geometric center, node, quadrant, intersection, insertion, perpendicular, tangent, nearest), polar tracking, ortho, grid snap |
| Layers & properties | Layers palette and Layer Properties Manager (on/off, freeze, lock, plot, colour, linetype), layer tools (isolate, freeze, off, lock, match, previous), Properties palette with per-object editing, linetypes, lineweights, colour index and true colour |
| Annotation | Dimensions (linear, aligned, radius, diameter, angular, ordinate, arc length) rendered from DIMSTYLE settings, our own single-stroke drafting font, `%%d %%p %%c` codes, MTEXT wrapping and attachment |
| Hatch & blocks | Pattern and solid hatches with our own pattern library, block references with attributes and nested blocks |
| Files | DXF read/write (R12–2018), DWG read/write (R13–2018, via the acadrust library), SVG and PNG export |
| Automation | MCP server, JSON control channel, `cadcraft-cli` (info, convert, run, commands, mcp) |

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/cadcraft
cd cadcraft
cargo run --release -p cadcraft -- --sample       # opens the sample drawing
```

Then try typing at the command line:

```text
line 0,0 @10,0 @0,5 c          a closed triangle
circle 5,2 1                    a circle
offset 0.25                     then pick the circle and a side
zoom e                          zoom to extents
```

The web build: `cd apps/cadcraft-web && trunk serve` (needs [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev)).

## Drive it from agents, MCP and the CLI

```sh
# MCP server on stdio, headless:
cadcraft-cli mcp
# …or bridged to the running app (start it with --control 7979):
cadcraft-cli mcp --connect 127.0.0.1:7979

# One-shot headless runs:
cadcraft-cli run --sample --script 'CIRCLE 22,3 1\n' --save out.dxf --export out.png
cadcraft-cli info drawing.dxf
cadcraft-cli convert drawing.dxf drawing.svg
```

MCP tools include `command_line` (type at the prompt), `execute` (any command with JSON),
`inspect_drawing`, `query_entities`, `render` (returns a PNG) and, when connected to the app,
`screenshot` and `ui_click`. The desktop app's JSON control channel is documented in
[docs/control-protocol.md](docs/control-protocol.md).

## Architecture

```text
geom ─┐                       f64 geometry: arcs, bulges, splines, intersections, offsets
dxf   │  (standalone)         DXF tag reader/writer
color ┤                       colour index, true colour
doc   ┤                       drawing database, copy-on-write entity store (cheap undo)
fonts ┤ render               stroke font + TEXT/MTEXT layout │ display lists, linetypes, hatches, dims, CPU raster
io    ┤                       DXF mapping, SVG/PNG export
engine┤                       sessions, commands, command line + prompts, snaps, selection, undo
ui-egui · mcp                 the swappable egui front end · MCP server
apps: cadcraft · cadcraft-cli · cadcraft-web
```

Nothing below `ui-egui` knows about egui, so the front end can be replaced. `cargo xtask ci`
checks formatting, clippy, tests, asset attribution, the crate layering and the wasm build.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for milestones, measured parity and the estimate of remaining work.

## The Crafting Apps

CADCraft is one of the **Crafting Apps**: free, open-source creative tools from the
[ArtCraft](https://getartcraft.com/) team, each written from scratch in Rust and each able to
stand on its own.
